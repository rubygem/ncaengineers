	<p>Neil Cameron Associates Ltd was established in 2003, by Neil Cameron, having spent over 34 years in the Electricity Supply Industry working for the CEGB/National Grid Company, on systems up to 400KV. </p>

	<p>The company is growing organically, spending the last 10 years working on Distribution Networks for both DNOs and IDNOs, along with Private Networks, which has become our core business.</p>

	<p>We pride ourselves on identifying requirements, often missed, for example, by DNOs or even our clients, particularly when Codes of Practice change, thereby, exceeding expectations.    </p>
